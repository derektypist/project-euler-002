# Project Euler 002 - Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci Sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.  By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci Sequence whose values do not exceed a certain value (e.g. 4 million), find the sum of the even-valued terms.

The aim is to implement this using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
